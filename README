This repository provides a utility that can be used to launch a tmux session against a Tetration cluster.

*** Best results with Mac OSX + iTerm2 + Tmux 2.6

INSTALLING:

This step is not required - just run 'make connect' and it will install the virtualenv if it is missing.
Run 'make install' to install all prerequisites for this.

RUNNING:

Run 'CLUSTER=daffy make connect' to fire off the tmux session in the current terminal.
