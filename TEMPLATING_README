This repository provides a YML file that can be used to launch a tmux session against a Tetration cluster.

It also contains the original Jinja templates used to generate vcluster.yml

CUSTOMIZATION:

Make a copy of vcluster56.yml and sed replace all occurrences of 56 with the vcluster of your choice.

REGENERATION FROM TEMPLATE:

Edit generate.py and run it to generate the new tmuxp yml file.
